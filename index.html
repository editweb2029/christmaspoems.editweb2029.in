            <p class="para1">
                Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br>Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. <br>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, <br>In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there. <br>The children were nestled all snug in their beds, <br>While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads. <br>And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, <br>Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap. <br>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, <br>I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. <br>Away to the window I flew like a flash, <br>Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. <br>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow <br>Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below. <br>When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, <br>But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer. <br>With a little old driver, so lively and quick, <br>I knew in a moment it must be St Nick. <br>More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, <br>And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name! <br>"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen! <br>On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, Donner and Blitzen! <br>To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! <br>Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!" <br>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, <br>When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky. <br>So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, <br>With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too. <br>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof <br>The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. <br>As I drew in my head, and was turning around, <br>Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound. <br>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, <br>And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot. <br>A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back, <br>And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack. <br>His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! <br>His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! <br>His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, <br>And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow. <br>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, <br>And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath. <br>He had a broad face and a little round belly, <br>That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly! <br>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, <br>And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself! <br>A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, <br>Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. <br>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, <br>And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk. <br>And laying his finger aside of his nose, <br>And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose! <br>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, <br>And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. <br>But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight, <br>"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!" <br>

                SLEEP, sleep, beauty bright,<br>
                Dreaming in the joys of night; <br>
                Sleep, sleep; in thy sleep <br>
                Little sorrows sit and weep. <br>
            
                Sweet babe, in thy face <br>
                Soft desires I can trace, <br>
                Secret joys and secret smiles, <br>
                Little pretty infant wiles. <br>
            
                As thy softest limbs I feel, <br>
                Smiles as of the morning steal <br>
                O'er thy cheek, and o'er thy breast <br>
                Where thy little heart doth rest. <br>
            
                O the cunning wiles that creep <br>
                In thy little heart asleep! <br>
                When thy little heart doth wake, <br>
                Then the dreadful night shall break. <br>

                Minstrels a Christmas Poem 
            </p><br>
            <p class="para1">
                The minstrels played their Christmas tune <br>To-night beneath my cottage-eaves; <br>While, smitten by a lofty moon, <br>The encircling laurels, thick with leaves, <br>Gave back a rich and dazzling sheen, <br>That overpowered their natural green. <br>Through hill and valley every breeze <br>Had sunk to rest with folded wings: <br>Keen was the air, but could not freeze, <br>Nor check, the music of the strings; <br>So stout and hardy were the band <br>That scraped the chords with strenuous hand. <br>And who but listened?--till was paid <br>Respect to every inmate's claim, <br>The greeting given, the music played <br>In honour of each household name, <br>Duly pronounced with lusty call, <br>And "Merry Christmas" wished to all. <br>

                 Ring Out , Wild Bells
            </p><br>
            <p class="para1">
                Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky, <br>The flying cloud, the frosty light; <br>The year is dying in the night; <br>Ring out, wild bells, and let him die. <br>Ring out the old, ring in the new, <br>Ring, happy bells, across the snow: <br>The year is going, let him go; <br>Ring out the false, ring in the true. <br>Ring out the grief that saps the mind, <br>For those that here we see no more, <br>Ring out the feud of rich and poor, <br>Ring in redress to all mankind. <br>Ring out a slowly dying cause, <br>And ancient forms of party strife; <br>Ring in the nobler modes of life, <br>With sweeter manners, purer laws. <br>Ring out the want, the care the sin, <br>The faithless coldness of the times; <br>Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes, <br>But ring the fuller minstrel in. <br>Ring out false pride in place and blood, <br>The civic slander and the spite; <br>Ring in the love of truth and right, <br>Ring in the common love of good. <br>Ring out old shapes of foul disease, <br>Ring out the narrowing lust of gold; <br>Ring out the thousand wars of old, <br>Ring in the thousand years of peace. <br>Ring in the valiant man and free, <br>The larger heart, the kindlier hand; <br>Ring out the darkness of the land, <br>Ring in the Christ that is to be. <br>

                Little tree
            </p><br>
            <p class="para1">
                little silent Christmas tree <br>
                you are so little <br>
                you are more like a flower <br>
                who found you in the green forest <br>
                and were you very sorry to come away? <br>
                see i will comfort you <br>
                because you smell so sweetly <br>
                i will kiss your cool bark <br>
                and hug you safe and tight <br>
                just as your mother would, <br>
                only don't be afraid <br>
                look the spangles <br>
                that sleep all the year in a dark box <br>
                dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine, <br>
                the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads, <br>
                put up your little arms <br>
                and i'll give them all to you to hold <br>
                every finger shall have its ring <br>
                and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy <br>
                then when you're quite dressed <br>
                you'll stand in the window for everyone to see <br>
                and how they'll stare! <br>
                oh but you'll be very proud <br>
                and my little sister and i will take hands <br>
                and looking up at our beautiful tree <br>
                we'll dance and sing <br>
                "Noel Noel" <br>
